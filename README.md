## My process

I wanted to use Sass for this challenge so I started by watching tutorials and reading instructions. Then I wrote the HTML followed by the CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Sass
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I extended my knowledge of CSS Grid and started my learning of Sass.


### Continued development

Continue learning about Sass, use of @mixin and functions. I also want to learn about React and do a project.


### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - The Sass guide
- [Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=2967s) - This tutorial taught me the basics of Sass
- [Learn CSS Grid the Easy Way - Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=174s) - I watched this tutorial a while before I did this challenge and tried to write the code myself, instead of copying from the tutorial.
